In this tutorial, we're using flexbox, grid, some JQuery sprinkles and using responsive design.

I encourage to have at least a basic understanding of `flexbox` and `grid` in order to have a smooth learning progress. For Key Stage 4 class and above.
Consider these as an afterschool activity.

Main takeaways:

- Navigation (sticky)
- Background video
- `:hover` css pseudo-class
- `transition` & `transform` css property
- html entity
- media queries
- `$` selector in JQuery
- JQuery basics
- CSS Flexbox & Grid
